				I also participate in several clubs during the school year. One of which is Project Interact which is a club that participates in many community service events within our community
				</P> 

				<p>
				I also participate in the National Art Honor Society. In this club we meet weekly to discuss how we can better our school and community through art projects. In the past we have painted murals in town, in the school, and have put on local art shows.

			<h2 id="Academics">Academics</h2>
				<p>
					My favorite classes in school are Physics and Math. I also am very involved in the art program at my school. For the past two years I have been developing my porfolio in my Studio Art Class so I can submit it to colleges next year. Drawing and Painting are my favorite mediums that I use for my projects. Next year I will be enter my second year in both A.P. Physics and A.P. Studio Art.
